        "Article Content": "Cloudflare, Inc. released a new study focused on cybersecurity in Asia Pacific. The report, called “Navigating the New Security Landscape: Asia Pacific Cybersecurity Readiness Survey,” shares the latest data on cybersecurity preparedness in the region, revealing how organisations are coping with ransomware, data breaches, and additional challenges brought about by artificial intelligence (AI). The survey found that 93% of respondents in India are concerned about AI increasing the sophistication and severity of data breaches. Additionally, 55% of respondents said their organisation experienced data branches in the past 12 months, with 52% indicating they suffered from 11 or more data breaches. The industries that experienced the most data breaches were Healthcare (69%), Transportation (67%), and Business and Professional Services (62%). Threat actors most frequently target customer data (37%), user access credentials (15%), and financial data (14%) Ransomware remains a major concern for India. The study reveals that 84% of organizations that experienced ransomware attacks in the last two years said they paid the ransom, despite 89% of these organisations issuing public pledges against doing so. Overall, compromised Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) servers (55%) proved to be the most common means of entry by threat actors \"In today's landscape, cyberattacks hit every level of an organization, putting security leaders under intense pressure and scrutiny. With limited resources and increasingly complex IT environments, the challenges are growing. To stay ahead of evolving threats, leaders must constantly reassess their resources, tools, and strategies to protect their organizations effectively,” said  “Regulation” and “compliance” also emerged as important themes in this year’s study. The survey shows that 52% of respondents said they spend more than 5% of their IT budget to address regulatory and compliance requirements. In addition, 59% of respondents reported spending more than 10% of their work week keeping pace with industry regulatory requirements and certifications. However, this investment in regulation and compliance has had a positive impact on businesses, such as improving the integrity of the organisation’s technology and data (63%), improving the organisation’s baseline privacy and/or security levels (61%), and improving the organisation’s reputation and brand (59%). Defending against cyberattacks continues to be a top priority, with 80% of respondents revealing that more than 10% of their organisation’s IT budget was spent on cybersecurity. This survey was conducted on behalf of Cloudflare across a total of 3,844 cybersecurity decision-makers and leaders from small (250 to 999 employees), medium (1,000 to 2499 employees), and large (more than 2,500 employees) organizations.  Respondents were drawn from a wide range of industries: Business & Professional Services; Construction & Real Estate; Education; Energy, Utilities & Natural Resources; Engineering & Automotive, Financial Services; Gaming; Government; Healthcare; IT & Technology; Manufacturing; Media & Telecoms; Retail; Transportation; Travel, Tourism & Hospitality.  Respondents were based in 14 markets across Asia Pacific: Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam (n=201 to 405 per country), and were surveyed online and recruited via general business panels.  The survey was aimed at building a better understanding of the threat landscape facing Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and their teams across the vast and varied territories of Asia Pacific, and the challenges they faced around paradigms like complexity, compliance and talent. The survey was conducted in June 2024.  👉 ",

        "Author Name": "NDM News Network",
        "Author URL": "https://digitalterminal.in/author/ndm-news-network",
        "Article Content": "Commvault, released new critical insights from its 2024 Cyber Recovery Readiness Report. This global survey of 1,000 security and IT professionals across 11 countries, reveals interesting behavior changes for organizations that have been breached versus those that have not. The Commvault survey, done in collaboration with GigaOm, shows that organizations that have endured cyber incidents in the past don't want to get burned again. Consequently, they often reassess and invest in cyber resilience and recovery strategies in very meaningful ways. According to the survey: Investments in cyber resilience increase: Organizations that have been breached spend nearly 30% more on cybersecurity measures than those that haven't. More attention is given to understanding data risk profiles: Breached organizations are nearly 2.5 times more likely to prioritize understanding their data risk profiles, which highlight data types and relative levels of risk. Cyber readiness testing is prioritized: Breached organizations conduct more testing to find gaps in their cyber preparedness plans. Twenty percent of organizations that haven't been breached do not test their recovery plan at all, that number drops to just 2% for organizations that have been breached. The impact of these added investments and focus on cyber resilience is significant. According to the survey, breached organizations that have invested in comprehensive cyber recovery plans recover 41% faster than their less-prepared counterparts. In terms of specific recovery times, breached organizations state that they are 32% more likely to recover within 48 hours compared to those that have not been breached – a much better outcome than the recovery times noted by other respondents, which could be three weeks or more. This reduced downtime can translate to significant savings, both in terms of direct financial losses and the preservation of customer trust and brand reputation. \"We've all heard the expression hindsight is 20/20, and that could not be more applicable when it comes to the findings of this survey,\" said  . \"Our survey shows that the most resilient organizations are those that continuously test and refine their recovery strategies, learning from each incident to strengthen their defenses. It's this proactive mindset, rather than reactive spending, that makes the difference.\" Much like health insurance, where the cost of coverage often far outweighs the potential expenses of medical emergencies, cyber recovery readiness serves a similar purpose. The report underscores that the costs of being breached – ranging from operational disruption to regulatory fines – far exceed the expenses of proactive cyber resilience measures. \"The findings should be a call to action for all organizations, not just those that have been breached,\" said  . \"Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and so too must the strategies to counter them. It's about adopting a holistic approach to cyber resilience that integrates people, processes, and technology, ensuring readiness at every level.\" In addition to these findings, Commvault and GigaOm were able to pinpoint five key capabilities, also called resiliency markers, that when deployed together, helped companies recover faster from cyberattacks and experience fewer breaches compared to companies that did not follow the same path. These five resiliency markers emerged after data analysis teams combed through the same survey results across a range of topics including: how often companies were breached, what resilience technologies were (or were not) deployed, and how rapidly businesses were able to recover data and resume normal operations.  👉 ",

        "Article Content": "To ensure cyber security for the country, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah has proclaimed several new initiatives. As part of the program, the ministry has decided to train 5,000 cyber commandos’, establish a web-based data registry, and introduce a portal to report cybercrime information. The Home Minister was addressing the first Foundation Day commemoration of I4C (Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre) on Tuesday, in New Delhi. During his address, Shah also announced the foundation of CFMC (Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre) in attendance with major banks, payment aggregators, financial intermediaries, IT intermediaries, telecom service providers, law enforcement agencies from Union and state territories, and others. Under the CFMC, all agencies are tasked with collaborating to ensure prompt action against online financial crimes, exemplifying the concept of “cooperative federalism” in law enforcement. The Home Minister also confirmed that the joint venture of seven cyber coordination teams has delivered satisfactory results in Mewat, Ahmedabad, Jamtara, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Guwahati, and Visakhapatnam. Along with that, the cyber media initiative CyberDost under I4C has successfully executed an awareness campaign on multiple social media handles. Shah advocates the necessity of a precise strategy to move together in the direction to achieve the goal. The Samanvay Platform, a Joint Cybercrime Investigation Facilitation System, represents a significant step forward. This web-based module will act as a centralized portal, serving as a core repository for cybercrime data and facilitating data sharing, analytics, crime mapping, and enhanced cooperation and coordination. 'The Cyber Commandos' program is a specialized team of trained personnel established in states and UTs and CBI-like central police organizations to address cybersecurity threats. These trained cyber commandos are anticipated to support both central and state agencies in safeguarding the digital landscape. A registry of suspects is being developed based on the NCRP (National Cybercrime Reporting Portal), which is collaborating with financial intermediaries and banks to boost fraud risk management potential in India’s financial ecosystem. The Union Home Minister also noted that India commutes 46% of digital transactions across the globe which underscores the increase in internet users from 250M on March 31, 2014- 950M on March 31, 2024. He also pointed out that data consumption has surged nearly 78-fold to 20.27 GB from 0.26 GB, driven by increased download speeds and reduced costs.Top of Form Also, he highlighted that the Digital India initiative has brought many services online, with digital transactions amounting to ₹20.64 lakh crore in 2024. So far, the I4C has issued more than 600 advisories and blocked social media pages, websites, accounts, and mobile apps utilized by cybercriminals.  👉 ",

        "Author Name": "NDM News Network",
        "Author URL": "https://digitalterminal.in/author/ndm-news-network",
        "Article Content": "As the reach of artificial intelligence (AI) expands, IT leaders are exploring new use cases for technology used throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), according to a new survey launched today titled “AI in software development: Exploring opportunities and uncertainties” by OutSystems, a global leader transforming how companies innovate through software, and KPMG, a multinational professional services network. The research surveyed 555 software executives around the world whose companies span IT consultancy services, manufacturing, banking, financial services and insurance among others. 84 percent of respondents reported that their organizations first began to incorporate AI technologies in their SDLCs between six months to five years ago, with the earliest adopters primarily being IT services companies. Across regions, EMEA and North America remain roughly on equal footing, while APAC is steadily catching up. The findings show that testing, quality assurance, and security vulnerability detection are by far the most widely adopted use cases for AI in software development. Nonetheless, generative AI (GenAI) is set to transform the industry by significantly enhancing these processes and introducing unprecedented capabilities. Early adopters are planning to increase their use of AI in other stages of the SDLC, such as user interface design, code generation, DevOps optimization, and application maintenance. Nearly all respondents are planning to increase their investment in AI-augmented SDLC management over the next two years, indicating that AI will play a central role in driving innovation and competitive advantage in the software industry. “AI is redefining the impossible,” said Paulo Rosado, CEO and founder at OutSystems. “I’m laser-focused on helping teams compress multi-year legacy modernization projects into just a few months. The latest AI disruptions have brought us the potential to compress these development timelines into even shorter and faster projects. With AI, historically impossible transformation projects are not only possible but easier, cheaper, and faster to accomplish.” “Right now, the developer’s role is shifting from code writer to code reviewer,” said Rodrigo Coutinho, Co-founder and AI Project Manager at OutSystems. “Large language models (LLMs) are a big help, but they still make mistakes. But as these models evolve, and trust in the resulting code improves, the developer’s role will be more akin to that of an orchestrator and acceptance tester of AI-generated outputs.” Despite being a nascent technology a couple of years ago, the report found that confidence in the quality of AI-generated code has risen substantially—half of respondents said that the implementation of AI has improved software quality, enhanced decision-making, and increased efficiency in software testing and quality assurance. But confidence is also paired with risk awareness surrounding tech debt in the form of orphan code and hallucinations, a lack of context for an organization’s specific coding needs, and scalability concerns. With strategy baked into AI in SDLC processes, 56% of respondents said they experienced or expected to experience a higher quality of applications, with fewer bugs and improved performance.   The AI opportunity is undeniably huge, but its wider adoption in other areas of the SDLC beyond software testing and vulnerability detection still face some barriers. Chief among these are data privacy and security concerns (56% of respondents) and regulatory and compliance challenges (42%). Moreover, 38% of executives cite difficulties integrating generative AI into existing workflows as the primary barrier to adoption. “There’s a lot of speculation on what will change with the rise of GenAI,” said Michael Harper, Managing Director at KPMG U.S. “While there will be challenges, those with effective change management initiatives will reskill and upskill their workforces, leading to AI and jobs evolving in tandem.” The speed and sprawl of AI, namely GenAI, is paving the way for an increase in investments for nearly all respondents. But risks concerning the reliability of AI-generated code persist, though they can be mitigated with existing approaches, such as user acceptance testing, unit testing, and regression testing. “It’s up to the developer working with AI to guarantee the quality of the deliverables, but this becomes way more efficient with AI,” said Coutinho. “AI is, in fact, a great partner in creating tests in synthetic data.” Other oft-cited concerns were the limited availability of skilled personnel and difficulties integrating GenAI into existing tech stacks and workflows. Fears of job losses are high as well, with 89% of respondents claiming that certain roles will be eliminated by AI. This falls in line with a broader industry trend over the last couple of years. However, in the longer term, AI may well create more jobs than it displaces, resulting in a new type of developer, equipped with specialized AI skill sets.  👉 ",

        "Title": "Oracle Introduces OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing to Prevent Data Breaches from Network Misconfigurations",
        "Author Name": "NDM News Network",
        "Author URL": "https://digitalterminal.in/author/ndm-news-network",
        "Article Content": "Oracle announced the availability of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Zero Trust Packet Routing which is built into the network fabric of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This helps to curtail any unauthorized access to data by separating network security from the underlying architecture. Based on the 2023 initiative to develop a new open standard with Applied Invention and other organizations, OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing enables organizations to set security attributes on resources and write natural language policies that limit network traffic based on the resources and data services accessed. As a result, organizations can safeguard themselves from one of the most common causes of compromise—network misconfigurations. OCI is the first cloud provider to implement Zero Trust Packet Routing (ZPR) into its platform. “As public clouds emerged, enterprises had the opportunity to redefine how they address network security,” said  . “However, they carried over most of the same concepts that tightly coupled security and network configuration. A single mistake in a highly complex cloud network can result in exposure. OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing enables organizations to decouple network configuration from security, helping to eliminate the effects of human network configuration errors. This new standard driven by Oracle flips this all too often checkbox item on its head to provide an innovative solution for organizations that simplifies compliance efforts, reduces the burden on security teams, and ultimately strengthens security.” “Traditional security tools try to protect sensitive data by blocking access, but history shows it is almost impossible to anticipate all the ways a hacker might attempt to infiltrate a network,” said  . “With Zero Trust Packet Routing, the network does not allow any data to move through the network without explicit permission. Organizations using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure can now take advantage of this to better safeguard their data. Oracle is the first to offer this new level of security, and we’re hopeful other cloud platforms will follow.” The new ZPR standard was needed as an organization’s network architecture changes each time an application is launched, a new instance is scaled up, or additional database servers are added. Using a traditional network architecture-based security approach is time-consuming due to the sheer complexity of securing and auditing the configuration points. In addition, responsibility is transferred to network teams to implement security requirements, which can result in human error. OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing helps address these challenges by separating network security from network architecture and enabling organizations to write security policies to enforce security intent at the network layer. This means traffic not explicitly allowed by policy will be restricted at the network level. As a result, organizations can: Improve security posture: Security teams can restrict access to sensitive data to a specific path, such as request origination host, network segment, or target data service. This helps reduce the attack surface area and safeguard against data exfiltration based on compromised credentials alone. Streamline compliance: Security teams can quickly and easily prove to auditors that the necessary security controls are in place to meet compliance requirements by limiting access to a single, authorized path with natural language policies. Simplify security management: Security teams can restrict access to sensitive data based on security attributes. Once a security attribute is set on data, security controls are automatically enforced based on the policies in place. This minimizes the need to deploy network-layer security rules based on characteristics such as IP addresses and ports. “Though cloud network security has evolved over the last two decades, organizations are still increasingly vulnerable to unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data due to security controls heavily reliant on user credentials,” said  . “OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing enables organizations to set security attributes on specific resources and then blocks traffic to those resources at the network level, making data security easier to understand, manage, and audit. It changes the paradigm of security in the cloud to protect organizations from malicious actors and the business-altering consequences of data breaches.”  👉 ",

        "Title": "DT Channel Survey 2024: Navigating Opportunities and Challenges in India's IT Channel",
        "Author Name": "Onkar Sharma",
        "Author URL": "https://digitalterminal.in/author/onkar-sharma",
        "Article Content": "The first every DT Channel Survey 2024, which provides a thorough analysis of the challenges and opportunities facing India's channel partner community, reveals that while channel partners generally view the existing frameworks—such as rewards distribution, sales training, and supply chain management—as effective, there is a clear need for targeted improvements. Conducted to understand the pulse of channel partners across the country, the survey also brings to the fore opportunities that can help enhance transparency in incentive programs, handle price parity concerns, tailor training to specific needs, and address critical supply chain challenges. Recognizing the pivotal role that the Indian IT channel fraternity plays in driving the adoption and expansion of IT products, this first ever DT Channel Survey aims to uncover the key dynamics at play in an evolving technology landscape, where emerging technologies such as Cloud, AI, IoT, and Blockchain are becoming increasingly central. Focusing on the domestic IT market, the DT Channel Survey 2024 highlights critical challenges and opportunities for channel partners. India's domestic IT market is currently valued at approximately $54 billion, according to Statista, with the hardware segment contributing around $14 billion and the software and services sector accounting for about $40 billion. This market is experiencing steady growth, fueled by the country's rapid digital transformation. The survey identifies several challenges that have emerged in the post-pandemic era: : Ransomware attacks, data breaches, climatic changes, and geopolitical issues have led to stock shortages and delays in fulfilling orders, significantly impacting channel operations. : The pandemic has accelerated the demand for collaboration tools, cybersecurity for remote access, and home office equipment. This shift has forced channel partners to adapt quickly to new market demands. : The economic environment, characterized by inflation and rising interest rates, has made it difficult for channel partners to extend credit and close deals, putting pressure on their financial stability. : There is an increased focus on digital transformation and cost optimization. Channel partners must stay ahead of technological trends to meet the evolving needs of their customers effectively. : The growth of online marketplaces and direct sales by vendors has intensified competition, requiring channel partners to innovate and adapt to maintain their market position. When asked, \"How do channel partners rate the quality of products and solutions provided by vendors and brands?\" the response was overwhelmingly positive. Nearly 80% of channel partners in India expressed satisfaction with the quality they receive. Interestingly, a significant portion of partners from tier 2 and tier 3 cities were notably more inclined to recognize the superior quality of products provided by the vendors they worked with. This confidence stems from the consistent reliability and innovation that these technology brands and vendors deliver. The high standards of quality and the robust support offered by vendors enable channel partners to effectively meet their clients' needs. Additionally, the strategic partnerships forged between vendors and channel partners grant access to cutting-edge technologies, giving them a competitive advantage in the market. This mutual trust and collaboration not only strengthen business relationships but also contribute to successful outcomes for both parties. In response to the question, \"Do brands maintain price parity between online and offline channels?\" nearly 66% of channel partners reported that price parity is not consistently maintained. This disparity poses significant challenges for offline retailers, especially during special occasions such as festivals, when consumers often perceive online prices as more competitive. These differences in pricing can disrupt market dynamics, influencing consumer behavior in favor of online purchases and potentially impacting the sales and loyalty of brick-and-mortar stores. The lack of price parity not only creates an uneven playing field but also affects the overall trust and relationship between brands and their offline channel partners. Addressing this issue is essential to ensuring fair competition and sustaining the viability of both online and offline retail channels. In response to the question, \"How would you rate the vendor/brand’s customer service support?\" nearly 89% of technology channel partners rated it as 'Good,' with only 11% rating it as 'Average.' This overwhelmingly positive feedback underscores vendors' strong commitment to customer service excellence. Effective customer service is a critical factor in channel partner satisfaction, ensuring smooth operations, quick issue resolution, and strengthened trust between partners and vendors. The high ratings indicate that vendors are not only responsive and supportive but also proactive in addressing the needs of their partners. This level of support is crucial for maintaining strong, long-term partnerships, enabling channel partners to deliver exceptional service to their end customers, which in turn bolsters brand loyalty and market competitiveness. However, the 11% 'Average' rating, though relatively small, highlights areas where improvement is needed. A continued focus on enhancing customer service can further elevate the overall partner experience, ensuring even greater satisfaction and success. In response to the question, \"What time does it take for products to be delivered after placing the order with brands or national distributors?\" the feedback reveals significant variations in delivery times. These inconsistencies can be attributed to several factors, including the efficiency of the brand's logistics network, regional distribution capabilities, and the specific types of products being shipped. While some channel partners report prompt delivery, others experience delays that can disrupt their ability to meet customer expectations and manage inventory effectively. These variations highlight the critical need for a robust and reliable supply chain. Timely product delivery is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring operational efficiency. Brands that consistently deliver products on time not only strengthen their relationships with channel partners but also build trust and foster loyalty. Conversely, inconsistencies in delivery times can lead to frustration and potentially damage the brand's reputation. To address these issues, it is crucial for brands to optimize their logistics processes, enhance communication, and increase transparency with their partners. In response to the question, \"How fair do you believe the distribution of rewards is within the current incentive programs?\" nearly 88% of channel partners rated the distribution as 'fair.' This strong majority indicates that most channel partners view the incentive programs as equitable and balanced. Fair distribution of rewards is crucial for maintaining motivation and engagement among channel partners, as it ensures that their efforts and contributions are appropriately recognized and compensated. However, while the 'fair' rating reflects a generally positive sentiment, it also suggests there is room for improvement. An ideal incentive program not only motivates channel partners but also clearly communicates the criteria for rewards, ensuring transparency and consistency. The 12% of partners who did not find the distribution fully fair might be facing challenges related to unclear reward criteria, perceived biases, or inconsistencies in reward distribution across different regions or partner levels. To address these concerns, brands should consider refining their incentive structures, enhancing communication, and ensuring greater transparency. By doing so, they can strengthen partner relationships and foster a more competitive and motivated channel ecosystem. Regularly assessing and adjusting the fairness of incentive programs will help align them with partner expectations, contributing to a more productive and satisfied channel network. In response to the question, \"How effective do you find the sales training sessions in improving your product knowledge and sales techniques?\" 66% of channel partners rated the training as 'effective.' This indicates that the majority of partners view the training sessions as beneficial for enhancing their understanding of products and refining their sales techniques. Effective sales training is crucial for empowering channel partners, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to better represent the brand, address customer inquiries, and close sales. However, with 34% of partners possibly finding room for improvement, there is a clear need for vendors and brands to re-evaluate and tailor their training content to specific contexts and partner needs. To further enhance the effectiveness of sales training sessions, brands could consider implementing more customized and interactive training modules, providing hands-on experiences, and offering continuous learning opportunities. Additionally, gathering detailed feedback from participants and regularly updating training content to reflect the latest product developments and market trends will ensure that the training remains relevant and impactful. By addressing these areas, brands can maximize the value of their training programs, leading to better-equipped channel partners and ultimately driving improved sales performance. When asked, \"What are the biggest challenges you face in your supply chain?\" channel partners identified several critical issues:  This emerged as the most commonly reported challenge, with nearly half of the partners significantly affected by the costs associated with transporting goods. High logistics expenses can erode profit margins and diminish the overall competitiveness of products. Factors such as fluctuating fuel prices, complex shipping routes, and the need for specialized transportation for certain products may exacerbate this issue. To alleviate these burdens, brands and channel partners could explore more efficient logistics strategies, partnerships with logistics providers, or alternative shipping methods.  A third of respondents expressed concerns about the risks of relying heavily on a limited number of suppliers. This dependence can create vulnerabilities, such as supply disruptions due to unforeseen events or imbalances in bargaining power. To mitigate these risks, channel partners and brands should consider diversifying their supplier base, developing contingency plans, and establishing stronger relationships with existing suppliers to ensure a more consistent and reliable supply chain. : These challenges highlight the importance of efficient inventory management and reliable delivery schedules. Limited product availability can lead to lost sales opportunities and dissatisfied customers, while delays in delivery can disrupt business operations and reduce customer satisfaction. To address these issues, improving inventory forecasting, investing in technology to enhance supply chain visibility, and working closely with suppliers to streamline production and delivery processes are essential steps. By identifying and addressing these specific challenges, brands and channel partners can enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and improve their ability to meet customer demand promptly and reliably. When asked, \"How have global supply chain disruptions impacted your business?\" channel partners identified several critical challenges: : A third of respondents reported substantial cost increases due to global supply chain disruptions. These escalations can be attributed to various factors, including higher raw material prices, increased shipping and logistics expenses, and additional tariffs or import/export restrictions. The rising costs can strain profit margins, forcing businesses to adjust their pricing strategies, which may affect their market competitiveness.  Another third of channel partners indicated challenges in fulfilling customer demand, a situation that can have serious repercussions on business performance and customer satisfaction. Disruptions may cause delays in production and delivery, resulting in missed sales opportunities and potential loss of customer loyalty.  Though less commonly reported, frequent product shortages still pose a significant concern. These shortages can disrupt business operations and limit product availability for customers, potentially leading to lost sales and a negative perception of the brand. To address these shortages, companies may need to improve demand forecasting, secure alternative suppliers, and enhance communication with their supply chain partners to proactively anticipate and mitigate potential disruptions. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes cost management, enhancing supply chain resilience, and refining demand forecasting and inventory strategies. By taking these steps, businesses can better navigate the complexities of the current global supply chain landscape, maintaining their competitiveness and ensuring customer satisfaction. When asked, \"What factors do you consider when choosing a vendor?\" channel partners identified three primary considerations: : Nearly half of the channel partners indicated that price and cost competitiveness is the most critical factor when selecting a vendor. This focus highlights the importance of financial viability in business partnerships, as competitive pricing directly influences profitability and market positioning. Vendors that offer competitive pricing are often more attractive to channel partners, helping them maintain a strong market presence.  A third of respondents prioritize product quality and reliability in their vendor selection process. This suggests that vendors who uphold rigorous quality control standards and consistently provide reliable products are more likely to be chosen as partners. Such products contribute to a stable and positive market presence, minimizing the risk of product failures or customer dissatisfaction.  About one-fifth of channel partners consider the reputation and history of a vendor to be a significant factor. This involves evaluating the vendor's track record, market standing, and overall credibility. A strong reputation often signals a vendor's reliability, ethical business practices, and commitment to delivering on promises. Channel partners tend to favor vendors with a proven history of stability, excellent customer service, and responsiveness to issues. These attributes are crucial for establishing long-term, trust-based partnerships that can withstand market fluctuations and challenges. It is important to note that a vendor's ability to provide high-quality, competitively priced products, combined with a solid reputation, plays a significant role in channel partners' decision-making processes. These factors are essential in shaping the success and sustainability of business relationships. 1.       : : Invest in upskilling your workforce to stay ahead in these rapidly evolving fields.
